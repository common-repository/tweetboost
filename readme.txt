* Successfully Published Tweets
* Unsuccessful Tweet Publishing Attempts
* Bad API Connections

= Highlights =

* Quickly schedule Tweets to Twitter without ever leaving the post edit screen.
* At any point in time, change the content of a Tweet to schedule a brand new Tweet for the same content.
* Visualize scheduled Tweets within our special Dashboard calendar widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many accounts can you connect? =

In TweetBoost Free you can connect one Twitter account. In TweetBoost PRO you can connect more than one.

= Can I schedule more than one Tweet per post? =

In TweetBoost Free you can schedule one Tweet per post, but after it's published you can change the Tweet content or schedule date to create a brand new tweet, so in theory it's very easy to create additional Tweets by revisiting a piece of content. In TweetBoost PRO you can create and schedule many Tweet variations for one post.
